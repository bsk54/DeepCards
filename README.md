Description: DeepCards is a single-page web application designed for studying vocabulary in any language. After you load a list of entries separated by "#" or a tab, each entry appears as a numbered card that displays only the word or phrase in your target language. Most languages have two columns, while Chinese and Pinyin use three columns with translations. An arrow in the corner toggles the card open or closed to reveal or hide the definition, and the word’s pronunciation plays each time you toggle. Each card also has a record button that captures and plays back your own pronunciation (with WAV fallback on iOS). You can manage multiple vocabulary lists via the dropdown menu, switch speech languages in the ☰ menu, and save, restore, or export your data. All of this is backed by localStorage.  # DeepCards
